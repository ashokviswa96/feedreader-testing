## What I did?

* Wrote a test to make sure that the allFeeds variable has been defined and that it is not empty.
* Wrote tests that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL and name defined and that they are not empty.
* Wrote a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default.
* Wrote a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
* Wrote a test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
* Wrote a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
